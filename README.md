This is a simple repository to allow developers to explore jUnit and Java.

You should be able to pull this project up in whatever IDE you desire.  A simple gradle build is available should you desire to use it.

To use gradle to check your work simply execute:
Linux / Cygwin / Mac OS X
`./gradlew build`
Windows
`gradlew build`

This command will compile all source, and run all tests.

Currently the project has 18 tests, 15 of which are expected to fail.  Your task is to manipulate ONLY the src/main/java code to cause all 18 tests to pass.
